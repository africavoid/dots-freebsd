# dots-freebsd
## These are all the dot files I use (some edited for FreeBSD use)
The changes for FreeBSD are mainly to do with fonts as some fonts have different names on FreeBSD, to Linux.
These might work on Linux as well but I have not tested them.
All of what is in here can be put in your $HOME directory and should just work
# chc script in .scripts/
This is a simple one line script that will change your .Xdefaults file on the fly to edit your XTerm/UXTerm/URXVT color scheme, they are all the same files but with different fonts and colors.
use is as follows 'sh .scripts/chc.sh [name of file]' and it should just work, replacing '[name of file]' with the scheme you want.
